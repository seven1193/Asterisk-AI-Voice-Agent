"""
Voicemail Tool - Route calls to voicemail.

This tool allows the AI to send callers to voicemail when requested.

IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR:
The FreePBX VoiceMail application requires bidirectional RTP and voice activity
before it begins playing the voicemail greeting. When a channel enters the 
VoiceMail application directly from Stasis (via continue), there can be a 
5-8 second delay before the greeting plays.

WORKAROUND:
The tool returns a message that asks the caller a question ("Are you ready to 
leave a message now?"). When the caller responds ("yes", "ok", etc.), it 
triggers voice activity detection and establishes the bidirectional RTP path,
allowing the voicemail greeting to play immediately.

Without this interaction, the VoiceMail app stalls and only begins after the
caller speaks or after an 8-second timeout.

Timeline Evidence (Call 1763009524.4793):
- 04:52:48.275 - continue() called
- 04:52:48.280 - Stasis ended (5ms)
- 21:52:48.xxx - VoiceMail app launched
- 21:52:48-56  - Channel setting write format (waiting for audio path)
- 21:52:56.xxx - Caller said "ok" → greeting played immediately
- Total delay: ~8 seconds until caller spoke
