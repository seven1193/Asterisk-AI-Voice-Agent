# ElevenLabs Provider Setup Guide

## Overview

ElevenLabs Conversational AI is a full-agent provider that combines speech-to-text, LLM reasoning, and high-quality text-to-speech in a single streaming API. Ideal for applications requiring premium voice quality with natural conversation flow.

**Performance**: 1-2 second response latency | Full duplex | Client-side tool execution

> **Note**: ElevenLabs is a **full agent only** provider. TTS-only mode for hybrid pipelines is not currently supported.

If you used the Admin UI Setup Wizard, you may not need to follow this guide end-to-end. For first-call onboarding and transport selection, see:
- `INSTALLATION.md`
- `Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md`

For how provider/context selection works (including `AI_CONTEXT` / `AI_PROVIDER`), see:
- `Configuration-Reference.md` → "Call Selection & Precedence (Provider / Pipeline / Context)"

## Quick Start

### 1. Create ElevenLabs Agent

1. Sign up at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
2. Navigate to [Agents Dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/agents)
3. Click **"Create Agent"**
4. Configure your agent:
   - **Name**: Your agent name (e.g., "Customer Support Agent")
   - **Voice**: Select from the voice library
   - **First Message**: Initial greeting
   - **System Prompt**: Define behavior and personality
   - **LLM Model**: Select model (GPT-4o, Claude, etc.)

### 2. Enable Agent Security (Required)

**CRITICAL**: Authentication must be enabled for API access.

1. In agent settings, go to **"Security"** tab
2. Enable **"Require authentication"**
3. This allows secure signed URL connections

Without authentication, the agent cannot be accessed via API.

### 3. Get Credentials

1. Get your **API Key** from [API Keys](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys)
2. Get your **Agent ID** from the agent dashboard URL (format: `agent_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# ElevenLabs Conversational AI (required)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xi-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Test API Key**:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/user" \
  -H "xi-api-key: ${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}"
```

### 5. Configure Provider

The ElevenLabs provider is configured in `config/ai-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
providers:
  elevenlabs_agent:
    enabled: true
    # API credentials loaded from environment variables
    # api_key: ${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}  # Read from env
    # agent_id: ${ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID}  # Read from env
    
    # Audio Configuration (fixed for ElevenLabs)
    input_sample_rate: 16000
    output_sample_rate: 16000
```

**Key Settings**:
- Audio format is fixed at PCM16 @ 16kHz (engine handles resampling from telephony)
- Voice, prompt, and LLM model are configured in the ElevenLabs dashboard
- Greeting is configured in the ElevenLabs dashboard (not YAML)

### 6. Configure Asterisk Dialplan

Add to `/etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf`:

```ini
[from-ai-agent-elevenlabs]
exten => s,1,NoOp(AI Voice Agent - ElevenLabs)
exten => s,n,Set(AI_CONTEXT=demo_elevenlabs)
exten => s,n,Set(AI_PROVIDER=elevenlabs_agent)
exten => s,n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)
exten => s,n,Hangup()
```

**Recommended**: Set `AI_CONTEXT` and `AI_PROVIDER` when you want an explicit per-extension override:
- `AI_CONTEXT` selects the context (profile, tools)
- `AI_PROVIDER=elevenlabs_agent` forces this provider for the call

If you omit these, the engine will select a context/provider using the precedence rules in `docs/Configuration-Reference.md`.

### 7. Reload Asterisk

```bash
asterisk -rx "dialplan reload"
```

### 8. Create FreePBX Custom Destination

1. Navigate to **Admin → Custom Destinations**
2. Click **Add Custom Destination**
3. Set:
   - **Target**: `from-ai-agent-elevenlabs,s,1`
   - **Description**: `ElevenLabs AI Agent`
4. Save and Apply Config

### 9. Test Call

Route a test call to the custom destination and verify:
- ✅ Greeting plays within 1-2 seconds
- ✅ AI responds with high-quality voice
- ✅ Duplex communication works (can interrupt AI)
- ✅ Tools execute if configured (hangup, transfer, etc.)

## Tool Configuration

ElevenLabs uses **Client Tools** - tools defined in the dashboard but executed by this system.

### Add Tools to ElevenLabs Dashboard

1. In agent settings, go to **"Tools"** tab
2. Click **"Add Tool"** → **"Client Tool"**
3. Add each tool schema below
4. Ensure tools show your agent in "Dependent agents"

### hangup_call

```json
{
  "name": "hangup_call",
  "description": "Use this tool when the caller wants to end the call, says goodbye, or there's nothing more to discuss. Always use a polite farewell message.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "farewell_message": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "A polite goodbye message to say before hanging up"
      }
    },
    "required": []
  }
}
```

### transfer_call

```json
{
  "name": "transfer_call",
  "description": "Transfer the call to another person, department, or extension. Use when caller requests to speak with someone specific.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "target": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The transfer destination - extension number, queue name, or department"
      }
    },
    "required": ["target"]
  }
}
```

### send_email_summary

```json
{
  "name": "send_email_summary",
  "description": "Send an email summary of the call to the caller. Use when they request a summary or confirmation.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "recipient_email": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Email address to send the summary to"
      }
    },
    "required": ["recipient_email"]
  }
}
```

### request_transcript

```json
{
  "name": "request_transcript",
  "description": "Send the full call transcript to the caller via email.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "recipient_email": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Email address to send the transcript to"
      }
    },
    "required": ["recipient_email"]
  }
}
```

## Context Configuration

Define your context in `config/ai-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
contexts:
  demo_elevenlabs:
    provider: elevenlabs_agent
    profile: telephony_ulaw_8k
    # Note: greeting and prompt are managed in ElevenLabs dashboard
    tools:
      - hangup_call
      - transfer_call
      - send_email_summary
      - request_transcript
```

**Important**: Unlike other providers, the greeting and system prompt are configured in the ElevenLabs dashboard, not in YAML.

### System Prompt Best Practice

Add a **CALL ENDING PROTOCOL** at the TOP of your system prompt to ensure transcript is offered before hangup:

```
CALL ENDING PROTOCOL (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):
When the caller indicates they're done (goodbye, thanks, that's all, etc.):
1. FIRST ask: "Before you go, would you like me to email you a transcript of our conversation?"
2. If they say YES:
   - Ask for their email address
   - Read it back and spell it out for confirmation
   - Use request_transcript tool
   - THEN use hangup_call with a warm farewell
3. If they say NO:
   - Use hangup_call tool with a warm farewell
4. NEVER skip the transcript offer - always ask before hanging up
```

**Tip**: Place important behavioral instructions at the TOP of the system prompt for highest priority.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Audio" or "Silence"

**Cause**: Environment variables not set or agent security not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Verify `.env` has both `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID`
2. Ensure agent has "Require authentication" enabled in dashboard
3. Check logs: `docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep -i elevenlabs`

### Issue: "Connection Timeout"

**Cause**: Invalid API key or agent ID

**Fix**:
1. Test API key: `curl -H "xi-api-key: $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY" https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/user`
2. Verify agent ID matches dashboard URL
3. Check network connectivity to elevenlabs.io

### Issue: "Tools Not Working"

**Cause**: Tools not configured in ElevenLabs dashboard or names don't match

**Fix**:
1. Verify tool schemas are added in ElevenLabs Agent → Tools tab
2. Ensure tool names match exactly (e.g., `hangup_call` not `hangup`)
3. Check tools are linked to your agent ("Dependent agents")
4. Check logs for `client_tool_call` events

### Issue: "AI Doesn't Hang Up"

**Cause**: `hangup_call` tool not configured in ElevenLabs dashboard

**Fix**:
1. Add `hangup_call` tool schema to agent's Tools tab
2. Update agent's system prompt to use the tool when user says goodbye
3. Example prompt addition: "When the user says goodbye or indicates they want to end the call, use the hangup_call tool."

### Issue: "Second Call Fails"

**Cause**: Provider state not reset between calls (fixed in v4.4.1)

**Fix**: Update to latest version - this was fixed in commit e123a45.

## Production Considerations

### API Key Management
- API keys are loaded from environment variables only (for security)
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for dev/staging/production

### Cost Optimization
- ElevenLabs charges per character of generated speech
- Monitor usage in ElevenLabs dashboard
- Consider voice selection (some voices cost more)

### Monitoring
- Track response latency in logs
- Monitor ElevenLabs API status
- Set up alerts for connection failures

### Voice Quality
- ElevenLabs offers premium voice quality
- Test different voices for your use case
- Adjust voice settings (stability, similarity) in dashboard
